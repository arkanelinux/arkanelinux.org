					<h1 class="font_thin padded_h">About Arkane Linux</h1>
					<p>Hi, I am Dennis ten Hoove, the founder and as of writing only maintainer working on Arkane Linux. Here I will give you a brief backstory on the Arkane project and a rough overview of its overarching philosophy and goals.</p>
					<h2 class="font_thin padded_hb">Philosophy</h2>
					<p>Arkane is driven by an experimental mindset towards the bleeding edge, when a new and upcoming technology hits it will quickly be adopted. Arkane will be one of the first distros to enable and ship by default with upcoming features and software which make a meaningful impact on the desktop user experience.</p>
					<p>Software should be used as intended, it should not be heavily extended and tweaked for this hurts the overall user experience. I am not a fan of distros who's interface looks like unicorn puke or where I am unable to touch the keyboard without triggering some unintended shortcut, the defaults are usually far more reasonable so I like to just have these unchanged. Arkane by default will ship with mostly stock software, only minimal and uninvasive tweaks which have can have a positive impact on the user experience and workflow are seriously considered and possibly implemented.</p>
					<p>The user interface should provide a uniform experience, I don't want Qt, Electron, Flutter etc.. apps on my GNOME desktop for they do not integrated nicely with it. Arkane does everything to ensure a uniform experience.</p>
					<p>Operating systems should provide a minimal template on which you can build your own fun. By default Arkane ships GNOME with most core apps and Mozilla Firefox, all the apps most users would expect on their desktop and nothing more.</p>
					<h2 class="font_thin padded_hb">History</h2>
					<p>Arkane started off with me exploring the Arch Linux build tools, once again impressed by the flexibility of Arch and its toolstack I quickly decided to take it further and mature this experiment in to a proper Arch Linux-based distro. And this is the point at which we are now, Arkane is taking shape nicely and nearing the beta stage.</p>
					<h2 class="font_thin padded_hb">The future</h2>
					<p>The first thing on the list would be to continue refining Arkane Linux, the software ecosystem is in constant motion and Arkane needs to tail it.</p>
					<p>A secondary goal would be to build an ARM variant of Arkane based on Arch Linux ARM.</a>
					<p>The third thing on the to-do list is to evaluate the feasibility of building an Arkane variant aimed at phones, starting with the Pinephone.</p>

					<h1 class="font_thin padded_h">About Arkane Linux</h1>
					<h2 class="font_thin padded_hb">Philosophy</h2>
					<p>Arkane is driven by an experimental mindset and the desire to tail the bleeding edge, when a new and upcoming technology hits it will quickly be adopted. Arkane will be one of the first distros to enable and ship by default with upcoming features and software which make a meaningful impact on the desktop user experience. That does not mean Arkane is a testing bed of alpha and beta quality software, software is only adopted once considered stable. Some examples being mutter-dynamic-buffering being default, which many distros already ship just Arch does not yet, and loupe and kgx were already in the Arkane repos and shipped as default long before they hit the Arch ones.</p>
					<p>Software should be used as intended, it should not be heavily extended and tweaked for this hurts the overall user experience. I am not a fan of distros who's interface looks like unicorn puke or where I am unable to touch the keyboard without triggering some unintended shortcut, the defaults are usually far more reasonable so I like to just have these unchanged. Arkane by default will ship with mostly stock software, only minimal and uninvasive tweaks which have can have a positive impact on the user experience and workflow are seriously considered and maybe implemented.</p>
					<p>The user interface should provide a uniform experience, I don't want Qt, Electron, Flutter etc.. apps on my GNOME desktop all with radically different widge styles. Arkane does everything to ensure a uniform experience.</p>
					<p>Operating systems should provide a minimal template on which you can build your own fun. By default Arkane ships GNOME with most core apps, upcomming GNOME circle apps and Mozilla Firefox. It keeps itself to shipping exclusively the apps most users would expect on their desktop and nothing more.</p>
					<h2 class="font_thin padded_hb">History</h2>
					<p>Arkane started off with me exploring the Arch Linux build tools, once again impressed by the flexibility of Arch and its toolstack I quickly decided to take it further and mature this experiment in to a proper Arch Linux-based distro. And this is the point at which we are now, Arkane is taking shape nicely and nearing the beta stage.</p>
					<p>It started off as an attempt at making a full rebuild of Arch for x86-64-v3, a hugely fun project but the scripts written for it were (knowingly, damn you Docker for breaking fakeroot at the wrong time!) written with major architectural flaws. A full revision of all work was required to which means effectively redoing the entire buildbot project.</p>
					<p>Before I could seriously undergo this attempt at rewriting buildbot I started to think about immutability and its theoretical implementation. In theory implementing it should be trivial, so I attempted a manual configuration of such a setup and it was a huge success! After a couple of months of slowly writing Arkdep (initially named bttrfs, later Arkanium) I had all the basics implemented.</p>
					<p>Now, November 2023, about 1 year after the start of the project, I have done a "release", the software is now in such a state that it should be stable. I have every intention to continue maintaining Arkane and Arkdep, but will anyone other than me ever actually use it? Only the future could tell.</p>
					<h2 class="font_thin padded_hb">The future</h2>
					<p>The current and only goal I have will set is the continued development and refinement of Arkane and Arkdep, and to stamp out any lingering bugs.</p>
